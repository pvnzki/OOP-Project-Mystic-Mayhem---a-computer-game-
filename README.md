## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Implemented

This project demonstrates various Object-Oriented Programming principles:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- Private fields with public getter/setter methods
- Data hiding in character and item classes

### 2. **Inheritance**
- Character hierarchy (Player, Enemy, NPC extending base Character class)
- Item hierarchy (Weapon, Potion extending base Item class)

### 3. **Polymorphism**
- Method overriding in character subclasses
- Interface implementation for different behaviors

### 4. **Abstraction**
- Abstract classes for common character behaviors
- Interfaces for game actions and interactions

### 5. **Additional Concepts**
- **Composition**: Game contains multiple objects (characters, items, etc.)
- **Association**: Relationships between different game entities
- **Method Overloading**: Multiple constructors and methods with different parameters
